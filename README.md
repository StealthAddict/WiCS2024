Goal:
Single webpage app: shows everything we need on the front page. no login needed etc.


running (need two terminals):

t1: 
    python app.py

t2:
    cd client
    npm run build
    npm start


Design notes:
- Workshop/activity elements will have 4-6 main entries. These appear by default on the home page. Use flask loop to show them on screen.
